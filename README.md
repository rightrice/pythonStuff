 anything in the "S23" directory is work I did in my Python Class taken in the Spring 2023 semester at SUNY Canton. hopefully I can keep this repository more organized and be more active in this one than I was with my C Prog repository. a little back story of each big project...*drum roll please* :)
 
 **fudge.py**

fudge is a script i made in the very beginning of my python adventure. my parents have a fudge shop called Specc's Fudge so i wanted to make a script that would resemble taking someones order at the fudge shop. i play a lot of valorant so that is where the banned agents (names) came from as well as radiant rank.

**heyAlfred**

heyAlfred is an ai that can hopefully do anything you want it to do with a little bit of creativity. i wanted to make an ai that can replace hey google and alexa. i have plans to integrate heyAlfred into my car, but first i need to finish the scripting :)

**weatherBot**

weatherBot was my first idea when i decided to delve into python deep end first, and ironically is the last one i have started to work on. my plans for weatherBot is to have a script that you text in telegram to get a weather report for wherever you desire. it will call an API from OpenWeatherMap.
