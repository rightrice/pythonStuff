 anything in the "S23" directory is work I did in my Python Class taken in the Spring 2023 semester at SUNY Canton. hopefully I can keep this repository more organized and be more active in this one than I was with my C Prog repository. 
 
a little back story of each big project...*drum roll please* :)
 
 **fudge.py**

</a> 

fudge is a script i made in the very beginning of my python adventure. my parents have a fudge shop so i wanted to make a script that would resemble taking someones order at the fudge shop. i play a lot of valorant so that is where the banned agents (names) came from as well as radiant rank.

**heyAlfred**

</a> 

heyAlfred is an ai that can hopefully do anything you want it to do with a little bit of creativity. i wanted to make an ai that can replace hey google and alexa. i have plans to integrate heyAlfred into my car, but first i need to finish the scripting :)

**weatherBot**

</a> 

weatherBot was my first idea when i decided to delve into python deep end first, and ironically is the last one i have started to work on. my plans for weatherBot is to have a script that you text in telegram to get a weather report for wherever you desire. it will call an API from OpenWeatherMap.

**clickClack**

<a href="https://github.com/rightrice/pythonStuff/blob/main/clickClack.py">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/py-clickClack-orange?style=flat-square&logo=Python">
</a> 

clickClack is a fun twist on the terminal. a toast to the old days when typewriters ruled the world of typing. i wanted to pay homage in a way that also played a role in my learning of a new craft, being python. my current issue with the project is that after the intial ```clickClack("hello, i am rightrice")```, the audio stops the rest of the module from running. I will continue to tinker with it along with the rest of my projects. In the meantime, feel free to import clickClack and use it in place of print for projects you feel could use a little nostalgia :)
